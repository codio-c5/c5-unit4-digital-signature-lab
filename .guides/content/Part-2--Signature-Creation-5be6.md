Follow these steps to create a signature:

- Create a file called NameMessage.txt and write a message to your partner in this file. This is the file you will sign and send to your partner. Confidentiality is not a concern in this communication so you will not encrypt it.
- Using Kryptos, create a signature on this file. Since you will be using the public and private keys you created in class, make sure to use the same algorithms and parameters for the signature. Save the signature in a file called NameMessageSignature. Take a screenshot of the screen showing that you have successfully created the signature. 
- Open MyMessage.txt and change the case of the first letter in the file (uppercase to lowercase or vice versa) and save it in NameMessage2.txt
- Send the files NameMessage.txt, NameMessage2.txt, and NameMessageSignature to your partner. 


Your partner will use Kryptos to verify the signature on both files. Note that the signature should verify on one file but not the other, even though they are very similar!
